To install MNI on your system, execute:

sudo python setup.py install

In order to get the scripts working you either have to copy them into your
execution path or modify your PATH variable to point to the script
directory.

An example configuration file is in scripts/config.ini. This example shows
how to configure 3 TelosB motes using their serial identifiers. You can get
the identifier by executing 'motelist' on your computer. The advantage of
serial identifiers instead of the serial port is that there are no
confusions in case you unplug a mote and it gets a new serial port assigned.
